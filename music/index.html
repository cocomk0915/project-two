      <h2>City by music</h2>

      <p>
        In order to learn more about someone, I think music is one of the
        perfect topics to start with. So, I want to share my passion and
        love of music with you here.

        From RnB, Disco, to gospel, music became a big part of my life.
        I like to listen to music so much that I often can think of
        certain music that goes well with paintings, brands, or even
        objects. As I lived in four different cities so far, there are some
        music that reminds me of each city. Meeting people who have various
        genre of music in different cities was a big joy for me. Music has
        always been there to uplift my mood, make me cry, complete assignments
        to, get inspired, and dance. With music, I felt more alive.

        Here are some of my favorite songs that reminds me of each city I have
        lived. Hope you enjoy! :)
